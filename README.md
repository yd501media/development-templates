## Setup Notes

When creating a new repository from this template, enable GitHub's Dependency graph
in repository settings so the security workflow can run dependency review checks.

Replace the CODEOWNERS placeholder with actual GitHub users or teams so review
assignment works as expected.

If you use ecosystems beyond npm, add them to `.github/dependabot.yml` so updates
are tracked.
